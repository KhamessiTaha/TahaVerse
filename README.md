## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Space Theme
The cosmic theme reflects my fascination with both technology and space exploration. The design uses:
- Deep space colors (blacks, blues, purples)
- Subtle animations mimicking celestial movements
- Star field backgrounds for depth
- Cosmic video backgrounds for immersion

### Performance Considerations
- **Video Optimization**: Background videos with fallbacks and reduced motion support
- **Lazy Loading**: Components and images load only when needed
- **Code Splitting**: Optimized bundle sizes for faster initial load
- **Responsive Images**: Multiple formats and sizes for different devices

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Reduced motion preferences respected

## 🌟 Key Components
