🎨 Design Decisions
Space Theme
The cosmic theme reflects my fascination with both technology and space exploration. The design uses:

Deep space colors (blacks, blues, purples)
Subtle animations mimicking celestial movements
Star field backgrounds for depth
Cosmic video backgrounds for immersion

Performance Considerations

Video Optimization: Background videos with fallbacks and reduced motion support
Lazy Loading: Components and images load only when needed
Code Splitting: Optimized bundle sizes for faster initial load
Responsive Images: Multiple formats and sizes for different devices

Accessibility

Semantic HTML structure
Proper heading hierarchy
ARIA labels for interactive elements
Keyboard navigation support
Reduced motion preferences respected
