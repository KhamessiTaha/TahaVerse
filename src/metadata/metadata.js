*How I created an award-winning interactive orrery that captivated NASA judges*

## 🌌 The Journey to Global Finalist

When I submitted CosmicVue to the 2024 NASA International Space Apps Challenge on October 5-6, 2024, I knew I had something special. But reaching **Global Finalist** status — placing in the top 40 out of over 10,000 submissions worldwide — exceeded my wildest expectations.

This is the story of how I, working solo under the team name "CosmoArchitects," built an interactive 3D orrery that brings the solar system to life, and the lessons I learned along the way.

## 🎯 The Challenge: Creating a Modern Orrery

The NASA Space Apps Challenge presented a fascinating historical challenge: create a modern version of the orrery — those mechanical models of the solar system first presented to Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery, in 1713. But this wasn't about building a physical model; it was about creating an **interactive web application** that displays celestial bodies including planets, Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), Near-Earth Comets (NECs), and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs).

The challenge was clear: build something that could educate the public about our solar system while making space science accessible and engaging. Working solo, I decided to go beyond the basic requirements and create not just one, but **two distinct orreries** within CosmicVue:

1. **Visual Orrery**: Focused on engaging, beautiful visualization of planetary and NEO motion
2. **Accurate Orrery**: Using precise Keplerian parameters for scientific accuracy

My vision was to bridge the gap between visual appeal and scientific precision — something that would captivate both casual space enthusiasts and serious astronomy students.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture: Building for the Stars

### Core Technology Stack
- **Three.js**: 3D graphics engine for rendering the solar system
- **React**: Frontend framework for responsive user interface  
- **NASA Open APIs**: Multiple data sources for real-time celestial positioning
  - Approximate Positions of the Planets
  - Small-Body Database Query
  - NASA's Open APIs for planetary and NEO data
- **Python**: Backend data processing and orbital calculations
- **Netlify**: Hosting and deployment platform

### The Dual Orrery Approach

What set CosmicVue apart was my decision to create two complementary experiences:

**Visual Orrery**: Prioritized user engagement with smooth animations, beautiful textures, and intuitive controls. This version makes space exploration feel accessible and wonder-inspiring.

**Accurate Orrery**: Implemented precise Keplerian orbital parameters for scientific accuracy. Every celestial body's position is calculated using real NASA data, making it a valuable educational tool for understanding actual orbital mechanics.

### The Science Behind the Visualization

The real challenge wasn't just making things look pretty — it was implementing accurate orbital mechanics as a solo developer. I had to work with Keplerian orbital parameters for hundreds of celestial objects:

- **Eccentricity (e)**: How elliptical the orbit is
- **Semi-major axis (a)**: The size of the orbit
- **Inclination (i)**: The tilt of the orbital plane
- **Argument of periapsis (peri)**: The orientation of the orbit
- **Mean anomaly (M)**: The object's position in its orbit
- **Mean motion (n)**: The speed of orbital motion

Each Near-Earth Object required real-time calculations to determine its precise position at any given moment, making the visualization both beautiful and scientifically accurate. The challenge was doing this efficiently enough to render hundreds of objects simultaneously without performance issues.

## 🚀 Key Features That Made the Difference

# Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Primordial Quantum Fluctuation Reconstruction: A Deep Learning Approach to Cosmic Inflation

**Abstract**

We present a novel application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to reconstruct primordial quantum fluctuations from cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. By incorporating the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation as a physics constraint, our approach bridges the gap between traditional cosmological simulations and modern deep learning techniques. This work demonstrates the potential of PINNs in scientific computing applications where physical laws must be rigorously enforced during model training.

## 1. Introduction

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides a direct observational window into the primordial universe, preserving imprints of quantum fluctuations that were generated during cosmic inflation and subsequently evolved into the large-scale structure we observe today. Traditional approaches to analyzing these fluctuations rely on statistical methods and numerical simulations, but recent advances in deep learning present new opportunities for extracting physical information from cosmological data.

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a paradigm shift in scientific machine learning, where differential equations governing physical systems are embedded directly into the neural network training process. Unlike conventional neural networks that learn purely from data, PINNs enforce physical consistency by incorporating partial differential equations (PDEs) as soft constraints in the loss function.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 The Mukhanov-Sasaki Equation

The evolution of scalar perturbations during inflation is governed by the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation:

$$\\frac{d^2 u_k}{d\\eta^2} + \\left(k^2 - \\frac{d^2 z}{d\\eta^2}\\frac{1}{z}\\right)u_k = 0$$

where:
- $u_k(\\eta)$ is the comoving curvature perturbation mode function
- $\\eta$ is the conformal time
- $k$ is the comoving wavenumber
- $z = a\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}$ with $a$ being the scale factor and $\\epsilon$ the slow-roll parameter

The effective potential is given by:

$$V(\\eta) = \\frac{1}{z}\\frac{d^2 z}{d\\eta^2} = \\frac{a^2 H^2}{c_s^2}\\left(\\nu^2 - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)$$

where $\\nu$ is the spectral index parameter and $c_s$ is the sound speed.

### 2.2 Initial Conditions

For modes that exit the horizon during inflation, the initial conditions in the sub-horizon regime are:

$$u_k(\\eta_i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2k}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{du_k}{d\\eta}\\bigg|_{\\eta_i} = -i\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2}}$$

These correspond to the Bunch-Davies vacuum state, representing the quantum mechanical ground state of the inflaton field.

## 3. Physics-Informed Neural Network Architecture

### 3.1 Network Design

Our PINN architecture consists of a multi-layer perceptron that takes conformal time $\\eta$ and wavenumber $k$ as inputs and outputs the mode function $u_k(\\eta)$:

$$\\hat{u}_k(\\eta) = \\mathcal{N}(\\eta, k; \\theta)$$

where $\\mathcal{N}$ represents the neural network and $\\theta$ are the learnable parameters.

### 3.2 Loss Function Formulation

The total loss function combines data fidelity and physics constraints:

$$\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{data}} + \\lambda_{\\text{pde}} \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{PDE}} + \\lambda_{\\text{ic}} \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{IC}}$$

#### Data Loss
$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{data}} = \\frac{1}{N_d} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_d} \\left|\\hat{u}_k(\\eta_i) - u_k^{\\text{obs}}(\\eta_i)\\right|^2$$

#### PDE Loss
$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{PDE}} = \\frac{1}{N_p} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_p} \\left|\\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{u}_k}{\\partial \\eta^2} + \\left(k^2 - V(\\eta_i)\\right)\\hat{u}_k\\right|^2$$

#### Initial Condition Loss
$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{IC}} = \\left|\\hat{u}_k(\\eta_0) - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2k}}\\right|^2 + \\left|\\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}_k}{\\partial \\eta}\\bigg|_{\\eta_0} + i\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2}}\\right|^2$$

## 4. Implementation and Results

### 4.1 Training Methodology

We employed automatic differentiation to compute the required derivatives in the physics loss terms. The network was trained using the Adam optimizer with adaptive learning rates, with particular attention to balancing the relative weights of different loss components.

### 4.2 Baseline Performance

Our preliminary results from Phase 1 demonstrated that conventional CNN-based approaches achieved test accuracies of approximately 45-50% on CMB patch classification tasks using Planck SMICA data. This baseline performance highlighted the limitations of purely data-driven approaches when dealing with the subtle statistical features present in CMB temperature fluctuations.

Key findings from Phase 1:
- **Models tested**: \`improved_cnn\`, \`resnet\`, \`physics_informed\` (basic)
- **Dataset**: Real Planck SMICA CMB temperature maps
- **Challenge**: CMB patches exhibit extremely subtle statistical differences that are difficult to classify from temperature-only data
- **Limitation**: Models relied purely on statistical features without incorporating physical laws

### 4.3 Physics-Informed Reconstruction

The transition to PINNs in Phase 2 represents a fundamental shift from classification to reconstruction. By enforcing the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation as a physics constraint, we can predict physically consistent mode functions that satisfy the underlying differential equation governing quantum fluctuation evolution.

**Current Progress in Phase 2:**
1. **Mathematical Framework**: Implemented the complete Mukhanov-Sasaki equation with proper boundary conditions
2. **Physics Loss Function**: Developed \`compute_mukhanov_sasaki_loss(...)\` to penalize solutions violating physical laws
3. **PINN Architecture**: Multi-layer perceptron with $(\\eta, k)$ inputs and $u_k$ outputs
4. **Automatic Differentiation**: Leveraged PyTorch's autograd for computing PDE residuals

## 5. Challenges and Future Directions

### 5.1 Computational Challenges

Training PINNs presents unique difficulties compared to standard neural networks:

1. **Gradient Pathologies**: Physics terms can dominate gradients, leading to training instabilities
2. **Multi-scale Dynamics**: The wide range of relevant scales in cosmological problems requires careful numerical treatment
3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The relative weighting of loss terms significantly affects convergence
4. **Computational Cost**: PDE constraints increase training time compared to purely data-driven approaches

### 5.2 Scientific Validation

Ensuring the scientific validity of PINN predictions requires:

- **Comparison with established numerical solvers** (e.g., CAMB, CLASS)
- **Cross-validation against observational data** from Planck, WMAP
- **Verification of physical consistency** across different scales and epochs
- **Statistical analysis** of reconstructed power spectra

### 5.3 Future Research Directions

Our ongoing research aims to extend this framework to:

1. **Quantum Gravity Signatures**: Detecting potential deviations from standard inflation models that could indicate quantum gravitational effects
2. **Non-Gaussianity Detection**: Identifying statistical anomalies in the primordial power spectrum that deviate from Gaussian predictions
3. **Multi-field Inflation**: Incorporating coupled scalar field dynamics for more complex inflationary scenarios
4. **21cm Cosmology**: Applying PINNs to high-redshift hydrogen observations for dark ages exploration
5. **Data Assimilation**: Integration with upcoming survey data from Euclid and LSST

## 6. Project Timeline and Milestones

## 7. Conclusion

Physics-Informed Neural Networks represent a promising approach for reconstructing primordial quantum fluctuations from cosmological data. By incorporating fundamental physical laws directly into the learning process, PINNs offer a principled method for combining domain knowledge with deep learning architectures. 

Our work demonstrates the evolution from purely data-driven approaches (Phase 1) to physics-constrained reconstruction (Phase 2), showing how the integration of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation as a physics constraint enables the prediction of physically consistent quantum fluctuation modes.

While challenges remain in training stability and computational efficiency, the potential for discovering new physics through AI-driven scientific computing makes this an exciting frontier for both machine learning and cosmology. The integration of physical constraints not only improves model interpretability but also enables extrapolation beyond the training data regime—a crucial capability for cosmological applications where direct experimental validation is impossible.

As we continue to refine our approach in the ongoing Phase 2 development, we anticipate that PINNs will become an increasingly valuable tool for exploring the quantum origins of cosmic structure and potentially uncovering signatures of new physics in the early universe.

# 🚗 The Challenge: Building CarVision

Imagine pointing your phone at any car and instantly knowing its make, model, year, and current market value. That's exactly what we set out to achieve with CarVision — a graduation project that pushes the boundaries of mobile AI and computer vision.

The challenge was immense: build an AI system capable of recognizing **899 different car models** from a single image and predict their 2024 market value, all within **2 seconds** on a mobile device. This isn't just another image classification project — it's a complete end-to-end solution that bridges deep learning research with practical mobile deployment.

## 📊 Dataset Deep Dive: DVM-CAR 2.0

Our foundation was the **DVM-CAR 2.0 dataset**, a massive collection of automotive data that presented both opportunities and challenges:

**Dataset Composition:**
- **1,451,784 vehicle images** at 300×300 resolution with removed backgrounds
- **899 car models** spanning 20 years of UK market data
- **6 CSV tables** containing non-visual attributes (brand, price, sales volume)
- **Severe class imbalance**: ranging from 1 to 4000+ samples per class

**The Imbalance Problem:**
When we analyzed the distribution, the reality hit hard. Some car models had thousands of training images while others had barely a handful. This severe imbalance meant that traditional training approaches would fail catastrophically — the model would simply memorize the most common classes while ignoring rare ones.

## 🔄 Advanced Preprocessing Pipeline

To tackle the dataset challenges, we developed a sophisticated preprocessing pipeline that goes far beyond basic image resizing.

**Step 1: Data Transformation & Labeling**
We restructured the entire dataset, creating a unified CSV file mapping each image to its corresponding make, model, year, and color attributes. However, we made a strategic decision to remove the "Color" attribute as our analysis showed it doesn't significantly impact price prediction.

**Step 2: Mathematical Threshold Calculation**
We didn't just arbitrarily choose augmentation targets. Instead, we calculated the optimal threshold using mathematical formulas:

**Average Class Weight Formula:**
$$\\omega_{Avg} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{c=1}^{N} w_c$$

**Individual Class Weight:**
$$\\omega_c = \\frac{S_{tot}}{K \\times n_c}$$

Where:
- $S_{tot} = 1,451,784$ (total samples)
- $K = 4,897$ (total classes)  
- $n_c =$ samples in class c

This gave us $\\omega_{Avg} = 7.607$, leading to a threshold of 40 samples per class. Any class below this threshold became a candidate for augmentation.

**Step 3: Strategic Data Augmentation**
For classes below our threshold, we applied **7 carefully selected augmentation techniques**:

1. **Gaussian Noise**: Adding realistic sensor noise
2. **Pixel Value Multiplication**: Simulating different lighting conditions
3. **Contrast Normalization**: Handling various camera settings
4. **Image Scaling**: Accounting for different distances
5. **Gaussian Blur**: Simulating motion or focus issues
6. **Image Rotation**: Handling different viewing angles
7. **Horizontal Flip**: Doubling perspectives for symmetric cases

**Step 4: Intelligent Data Chunking**
Rather than attempting to train on the entire dataset at once, we implemented a strategic chunking approach:

- Identified the **top 200 most populated classes**
- Selected **200 samples per class** to ensure balanced representation
- Created manageable training batches that fit within GPU memory constraints
- Enabled parallel processing and distributed training capabilities

## 🏗️ Model Architecture Evolution: Four Iterations to Excellence

Our journey involved developing and comparing four distinct model architectures, each building upon lessons learned from the previous iteration.

**Model 1 - Baseline (Frozen Transfer Learning)**
- **Architecture**: ResNet50V2 with all pretrained layers frozen
- **Custom Layers**: Global Average Pooling → Flatten → Dense(1024, ReLU) → Dense(200, Softmax)
- **Training Strategy**: Only train the final classification layers
- **Results**: 26 hours training, 27% test accuracy, 35% training accuracy

The baseline model's poor performance was expected — freezing all pretrained layers severely limited the model's ability to adapt to automotive-specific features.

**Model 2 - Selective Fine-tuning**
- **Architecture**: ResNet50V2 with first 40 layers unfrozen
- **Training Strategy**: Allow feature extraction layers to adapt
- **Hyperparameters**: Learning rate 0.0001, batch size 32
- **Results**: 105 hours training, 54% test accuracy, 79% training accuracy

This model showed significant improvement but came at the cost of extensive training time. The unfreezing strategy allowed better feature adaptation but required careful learning rate tuning.

**Model 3 - Advanced Fine-tuning**
- **Architecture**: ResNet50V2 with first 30 layers + BatchNormalization layers trainable
- **Custom Layers**: GAP → Flatten → Dense(1024, ReLU) → Dense(512, ReLU) → Dropout(0.5) → Dense(200, Softmax)
- **Innovation**: Strategic layer selection and dropout regularization
- **Results**: 48 hours training, 58% test accuracy, 83% training accuracy

Model 3 introduced dropout regularization and showed improved generalization while reducing training time through more selective fine-tuning.

**Model 4 - Full Regularization (Final Architecture)**
- **Architecture**: ResNet50V2 with all layers trainable
- **Advanced Regularization**: L1 regularization (0.01) + Batch Normalization + Dropout (0.5)
- **Custom Head**: GAP → Dense(512, ReLU) → BatchNorm → Dropout → Dense(200, Softmax)
- **Parameters**: 24,718,536 total (24,672,072 trainable)
- **Results**: 12 hours training, **62% test accuracy**, 80% training accuracy

Our final model achieved the best balance of accuracy, training efficiency, and generalization capability.

## ⚡ Training Process & Optimization Strategies

**Computational Infrastructure:**
- **Platform**: Google Colab Pro with Tesla T4 GPU (15GB RAM)
- **Framework**: TensorFlow 2.0 with Keras API
- **Challenges**: Limited GPU access and unexpected disconnections

**Training Methodology:**
Each model underwent rigorous training with careful monitoring:

- **Batch Processing**: 1000+ batches per epoch
- **Real-time Augmentation**: ImageDataGenerator for memory efficiency
- **Early Stopping**: Prevented overfitting with patience monitoring
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Adaptive learning rate reduction
- **Model Checkpointing**: Saving best weights based on validation loss

**Performance Metrics Evolution:**
- **Model 1**: Validation accuracy plateaued at 27.71% after 5 epochs
- **Model 2**: Steady improvement from 38.41% to 54.97% over 15 epochs
- **Model 3**: Dramatic improvement from 5.88% to 58.86% with additional fine-tuning
- **Model 4**: Consistent performance reaching 61% validation accuracy

## 💰 Price Prediction Intelligence: Mathematical Modeling

Beyond image classification, CarVision needed to predict 2024 market prices. We developed a sophisticated depreciation-based pricing model using mathematical formulas derived from economic principles.

**Core Depreciation Rate Formula:**
$$\\delta_d = \\frac{P_{init} - P_{adv}}{P_{init}} \\times 100$$

Where:
- $\\delta_d =$ depreciation rate for advertisement year
- $P_{init} =$ initial/entry price of the vehicle
- $P_{adv} =$ advertised price in the specific year

**Mean Average Depreciation Rate:**
$$\\Delta\\delta = \\frac{1}{N_{adv}} \\sum_{k=1}^{N_{adv}} \\delta_d$$

Where:
- $\\Delta\\delta =$ mean average depreciation rate for a specific car brand
- $N_{adv} =$ number of advertisements for that brand/year combination

**2024 Price Prediction Formula:**
$$P_{2024} = P_{adv} - (\\Delta\\delta \\times Age_{2024})$$

Where:
- $P_{2024} =$ predicted price in 2024
- $Age_{2024} =$ age of the car in 2024

### 🔭 Introduction

In the vast cosmos, pulsars are among the most fascinating objects — rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. Detecting these cosmic lighthouses in radio astronomy data is crucial for understanding stellar evolution, gravitational physics, and even testing Einstein's theory of relativity. However, manually sifting through thousands of pulsar candidates is a time-consuming process that demands automation.

The High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) surveys generate millions of pulsar candidates annually, with true pulsars representing less than 0.1% of all detections. This extreme class imbalance, combined with complex noise characteristics and instrumental artifacts, renders traditional manual inspection approaches computationally prohibitive for next-generation facilities such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).

### 📊 Dataset Overview and Statistical Analysis

The HTRU2 dataset contains 17,898 pulsar candidates described by 8 continuous variables derived from integrated pulse profiles and DM–SNR curves. With only 1,639 true pulsars among the candidates (9.16% positive class), this presents a classic machine learning challenge: high-stakes classification with severe class imbalance.

**Statistical Summary by Class:**

| Feature | Pulsars (Mean ± Std) | Non-Pulsars (Mean ± Std) |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| IP Mean | 111.08 ± 25.65 | 136.92 ± 34.78 |
| IP Std | 46.55 ± 6.95 | 55.68 ± 16.38 |
| IP Kurtosis | 0.48 ± 1.04 | 8.30 ± 14.98 |
| IP Skewness | 1.77 ± 0.86 | 1.91 ± 3.87 |
| DM Mean | 2.08 ± 1.33 | 12.61 ± 29.47 |
| DM Std | 7.37 ± 4.91 | 26.3 ± 19.47 |
| DM Kurtosis | 8.82 ± 4.08 | 8.35 ± 75.85 |
| DM Skewness | 104.86 ± 106.04 | 68.23 ± 114.33 |

Mann-Whitney U tests confirm statistically significant differences across all features (p < 0.001), with IP Kurtosis showing the strongest discriminative power (U = 2.18 × 10⁶, effect size r = 0.52).

### 🧮 Mathematical Framework

#### Problem Formulation

Let D = {(xᵢ, yᵢ)}ᴺᵢ₌₁ represent our dataset, where xᵢ ∈ ℝᵈ denotes the d-dimensional feature vector for candidate i, and yᵢ ∈ {0, 1} indicates the binary class label (0: non-pulsar, 1: pulsar). Given the severe class imbalance with P(y = 1) ≪ 0.5, we formulate pulsar detection as an optimization problem:

$$\\hat{f} = \\arg\\min_{f \\in \\mathcal{F}} \\mathcal{L}(f) + \\lambda\\Omega(f)$$

where $\\mathcal{L}(f)$ represents the loss function accounting for class imbalance, $\\Omega(f)$ is a regularization term, and $\\lambda$ controls the regularization strength.


#### Feature Space Characterization

The HTRU2 dataset characterizes each pulsar candidate using eight statistical features derived from two primary signal representations:

**Definition 1 (Integrated Profile Statistics):** For a folded pulse profile P(t) with t ∈ [0, T], we define:

$$\\mu_P = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T P(t) dt$$

$$\\sigma_P^2 = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T [P(t) - \\mu_P]^2 dt$$

$$\\gamma_{1,P} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[(P - \\mu_P)^3]}{\\sigma_P^3}$$

$$\\gamma_{2,P} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[(P - \\mu_P)^4]}{\\sigma_P^4} - 3$$

**Definition 2 (DM-SNR Curve Statistics):** The dispersion measure–signal-to-noise ratio curve S(DM) yields analogous statistics {μₛ, σₛ, γ₁,ₛ, γ₂,ₛ}.

#### Support Vector Machine Optimization

For the RBF kernel SVM, the optimization problem becomes

$$\\min_{w,b,\\xi} \\frac{1}{2} \\|w\\|^2 + C \\sum_{i=1}^N \\xi_i$$

subject to:
$$y_i(w^T \\phi(x_i) + b) \\geq 1 - \\xi_i$$
$$\\xi_i \\geq 0, \\forall i$$

where φ(x) maps inputs to a higher-dimensional space via the RBF kernel:

$$ K(x_i, x_j) = \\exp\\left(-\\gamma\\|x_i - x_j\\|^2\\right) $$

### 🔬 Methodology

#### Data Preprocessing Pipeline

Our preprocessing pipeline implements robust statistical transformations to handle outliers and scale heterogeneity:

**Robust Scaling Transformation:**
$$\\tilde{x}_{ij} = \\frac{x_{ij} - \\text{median}(x_j)}{\\text{IQR}(x_j)}$$

This approach minimizes sensitivity to outliers compared to standard z-score normalization.

**SMOTE Implementation:**
We apply Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance by generating synthetic examples in the feature space:

$$x_{\\text{synthetic}} = x_i + \\lambda \\cdot (x_{\\text{neighbor}} - x_i)$$

where λ ∈ [0, 1] is a random number and x_neighbor is a randomly selected neighbor of xi.

#### Model Validation Framework

We employ stratified k-fold cross-validation with k = 5 to ensure robust performance estimation:

$$\\text{CV}_k = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\mathcal{M}(\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{train}}^{(i)}, \\mathcal{D}_{\\text{val}}^{(i)})$$

where $\\mathcal{M}$ represents the metric function evaluated on training set $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{train}}^{(i)}$ and validation set $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{val}}^{(i)}$.

#### Hyperparameter Optimization

We implement Bayesian optimization using Gaussian processes for efficient hyperparameter search:

$$ \\theta^* = \\arg\\max_\\theta \\alpha(\\theta) = \\arg\\max_\\theta [\\mu(\\theta) + \\kappa\\sigma(\\theta)] $$

where μ(θ) and σ(θ) are the posterior mean and standard deviation, respectively, and κ controls the exploration–exploitation trade-off.

### 🏆 Comprehensive Results Analysis

#### Algorithm Performance Benchmarking

Our systematic evaluation yields the following performance hierarchy:

| Algorithm | ROC AUC | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|----------|
| SVM (RBF) | 0.9708 ± 0.008 | 0.8287 ± 0.017 | 0.9146 ± 0.014 | 0.8696 ± 0.012 |
| Random Forest | 0.9623 ± 0.011 | 0.8041 ± 0.023 | 0.8932 ± 0.019 | 0.8462 ± 0.018 |
| XGBoost | 0.9587 ± 0.013 | 0.7896 ± 0.026 | 0.8876 ± 0.021 | 0.8358 ± 0.020 |
| Neural Network | 0.9534 ± 0.015 | 0.7723 ± 0.029 | 0.8798 ± 0.023 | 0.8230 ± 0.022 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.9489 ± 0.016 | 0.7641 ± 0.031 | 0.8734 ± 0.025 | 0.8152 ± 0.024 |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.9456 ± 0.017 | 0.7534 ± 0.033 | 0.8687 ± 0.026 | 0.8071 ± 0.026 |
| Decision Tree | 0.9201 ± 0.023 | 0.6987 ± 0.041 | 0.8234 ± 0.034 | 0.7562 ± 0.035 |
| Naive Bayes | 0.8934 ± 0.028 | 0.6543 ± 0.046 | 0.7987 ± 0.039 | 0.7198 ± 0.041 |
| K-NN | 0.8712 ± 0.032 | 0.6234 ± 0.051 | 0.7645 ± 0.043 | 0.6876 ± 0.045 |
| AdaBoost | 0.8534 ± 0.035 | 0.5987 ± 0.054 | 0.7432 ± 0.046 | 0.6634 ± 0.048 |

The Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel demonstrates superior performance across all metrics, achieving state-of-the-art results with ROC AUC = 0.9708.

#### Decision Threshold Optimization

We optimize the classification threshold τ to maximize the F1-score:

$$\\tau^* = \\arg\\max_\\tau F_1(\\tau) = \\arg\\max_\\tau \\frac{2 \\cdot \\text{Precision}(\\tau) \\cdot \\text{Recall}(\\tau)}{\\text{Precision}(\\tau) + \\text{Recall}(\\tau)}$$

Optimal threshold analysis yields τ* = 0.42, balancing sensitivity and specificity for operational deployment.

#### Confusion Matrix Analysis

At optimal threshold, our test set performance yields:

| | Predicted Non-Pulsar | Predicted Pulsar |
|---|----------------------|------------------|
| **Actual Non-Pulsar** | 3,098 | 154 |
| **Actual Pulsar** | 28 | 300 |

This translates to:
- **Sensitivity** = 300/(300 + 28) = 0.9146
- **Specificity** = 3,098/(3,098 + 154) = 0.9526
- **Positive Predictive Value** = 300/(300 + 154) = 0.6608
- **Negative Predictive Value** = 3,098/(3,098 + 28) = 0.9910

### 🔍 Feature Importance and Explainable AI

#### SHAP Analysis

Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we provide model-agnostic feature importance rankings:

| Feature | Mean |SHAP| | Physical Interpretation |
|---------|------------|------------------------|
| IP Kurtosis | 1.741 | Profile peakedness |
| DM Skewness | 1.523 | DM curve asymmetry |
| DM Mean | 1.347 | Central DM value |
| IP Mean | 1.256 | Average profile intensity |
| DM Kurtosis | 1.198 | DM curve peakedness |
| IP Std | 1.089 | Profile variability |
| DM Std | 0.987 | DM curve spread |
| IP Skewness | 0.834 | Profile asymmetry |

The dominance of kurtosis features suggests that signal peakedness constitutes the primary discriminative characteristic.

#### Astrophysical Implications

The prominence of kurtosis features provides novel insights into pulsar signal morphology. High kurtosis values in integrated profiles reflect the characteristic sharp peaks of genuine pulsar signals, distinguishing them from broader RFI artifacts or noise fluctuations.

The mathematical relationship between pulse profile shape and kurtosis can be expressed as:

$$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[(P - \\mu_P)^4]}{\\sigma_P^4} - 3 = \\frac{\\int (P(t) - \\mu_P)^4 dt}{\\left(\\int (P(t) - \\mu_P)^2 dt\\right)^2} - 3$$

For genuine pulsars, the narrow duty cycle creates extreme deviations from the mean, resulting in elevated kurtosis values.

### 📈 Principal Component Analysis

PCA reveals that 73.2% of variance is captured by the first two components, suggesting effective dimensionality reduction potential. The principal components can be expressed as:

$$\\text{PC}_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^8 w_{1i} x_i$$
$$\\text{PC}_2 = \\sum_{i=1}^8 w_{2i} x_i$$

where w₁ᵢ and w₂ᵢ are the loadings for the first and second principal components, respectively.

### 📚 Mathematical Appendix

#### Derivation of Optimal Decision Threshold

The optimal decision threshold is derived by maximizing the F1-score:

$$F_1(\\tau) = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\text{Precision}(\\tau) \\cdot \\text{Recall}(\\tau)}{\\text{Precision}(\\tau) + \\text{Recall}(\\tau)}$$

where:
$$\\text{Precision}(\\tau) = \\frac{\\text{TP}(\\tau)}{\\text{TP}(\\tau) + \\text{FP}(\\tau)}$$
$$\\text{Recall}(\\tau) = \\frac{\\text{TP}(\\tau)}{\\text{TP}(\\tau) + \\text{FN}(\\tau)}$$

Taking the derivative with respect to τ and setting to zero yields the optimal threshold.

#### SHAP Value Calculation

For a given prediction f(x), the SHAP value φᵢ for feature i is:

$$\\phi_i = \\sum_{S \\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,p\\} \\setminus \\{i\\}} \\frac{|S|!(p-|S|-1)!}{p!} [f(S \\cup \\{i\\}) - f(S)]$$

where S represents all possible subsets of features excluding feature i.

#### Cross-Validation Variance Estimation

The variance of cross-validation estimates is:

$$\\text{Var}(\\text{CV}) = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^k (\\text{CV}_i - \\overline{\\text{CV}})^2$$

where CVᵢ is the performance on fold i and CV̄ is the mean performance across all folds.

This comprehensive analysis establishes machine learning as a transformative tool for astronomical discovery, bridging the gap between computational innovation and scientific understanding.
