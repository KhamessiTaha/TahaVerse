# Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Primordial Quantum Fluctuation Reconstruction: A Deep Learning Approach to Cosmic Inflation

**Abstract**

We present a novel application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to reconstruct primordial quantum fluctuations from cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. By incorporating the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation as a physics constraint, our approach bridges the gap between traditional cosmological simulations and modern deep learning techniques. This work demonstrates the potential of PINNs in scientific computing applications where physical laws must be rigorously enforced during model training.

## 1. Introduction

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides a direct observational window into the primordial universe, preserving imprints of quantum fluctuations that were generated during cosmic inflation and subsequently evolved into the large-scale structure we observe today. Traditional approaches to analyzing these fluctuations rely on statistical methods and numerical simulations, but recent advances in deep learning present new opportunities for extracting physical information from cosmological data.

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a paradigm shift in scientific machine learning, where differential equations governing physical systems are embedded directly into the neural network training process. Unlike conventional neural networks that learn purely from data, PINNs enforce physical consistency by incorporating partial differential equations (PDEs) as soft constraints in the loss function.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 The Mukhanov-Sasaki Equation

The evolution of scalar perturbations during inflation is governed by the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation:

$$\\frac{d^2 u_k}{d\\eta^2} + \\left(k^2 - \\frac{d^2 z}{d\\eta^2}\\frac{1}{z}\\right)u_k = 0$$

where:
- $u_k(\\eta)$ is the comoving curvature perturbation mode function
- $\\eta$ is the conformal time
- $k$ is the comoving wavenumber
- $z = a\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}$ with $a$ being the scale factor and $\\epsilon$ the slow-roll parameter

The effective potential is given by:

$$V(\\eta) = \\frac{1}{z}\\frac{d^2 z}{d\\eta^2} = \\frac{a^2 H^2}{c_s^2}\\left(\\nu^2 - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)$$

where $\\nu$ is the spectral index parameter and $c_s$ is the sound speed.

### 2.2 Initial Conditions

For modes that exit the horizon during inflation, the initial conditions in the sub-horizon regime are:

$$u_k(\\eta_i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2k}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{du_k}{d\\eta}\\bigg|_{\\eta_i} = -i\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2}}$$

These correspond to the Bunch-Davies vacuum state, representing the quantum mechanical ground state of the inflaton field.

## 3. Physics-Informed Neural Network Architecture

### 3.1 Network Design

Our PINN architecture consists of a multi-layer perceptron that takes conformal time $\\eta$ and wavenumber $k$ as inputs and outputs the mode function $u_k(\\eta)$:

$$\\hat{u}_k(\\eta) = \\mathcal{N}(\\eta, k; \\theta)$$

where $\\mathcal{N}$ represents the neural network and $\\theta$ are the learnable parameters.

### 3.2 Loss Function Formulation

The total loss function combines data fidelity and physics constraints:

$$\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{data}} + \\lambda_{\\text{pde}} \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{PDE}} + \\lambda_{\\text{ic}} \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{IC}}$$

#### Data Loss
$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{data}} = \\frac{1}{N_d} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_d} \\left|\\hat{u}_k(\\eta_i) - u_k^{\\text{obs}}(\\eta_i)\\right|^2$$

#### PDE Loss
$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{PDE}} = \\frac{1}{N_p} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_p} \\left|\\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{u}_k}{\\partial \\eta^2} + \\left(k^2 - V(\\eta_i)\\right)\\hat{u}_k\\right|^2$$

#### Initial Condition Loss
$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{IC}} = \\left|\\hat{u}_k(\\eta_0) - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2k}}\\right|^2 + \\left|\\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}_k}{\\partial \\eta}\\bigg|_{\\eta_0} + i\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2}}\\right|^2$$

## 4. Implementation and Results

### 4.1 Training Methodology

We employed automatic differentiation to compute the required derivatives in the physics loss terms. The network was trained using the Adam optimizer with adaptive learning rates, with particular attention to balancing the relative weights of different loss components.

### 4.2 Baseline Performance

Our preliminary results from Phase 1 demonstrated that conventional CNN-based approaches achieved test accuracies of approximately 45-50% on CMB patch classification tasks using Planck SMICA data. This baseline performance highlighted the limitations of purely data-driven approaches when dealing with the subtle statistical features present in CMB temperature fluctuations.

Key findings from Phase 1:
- **Models tested**: \`improved_cnn\`, \`resnet\`, \`physics_informed\` (basic)
- **Dataset**: Real Planck SMICA CMB temperature maps
- **Challenge**: CMB patches exhibit extremely subtle statistical differences that are difficult to classify from temperature-only data
- **Limitation**: Models relied purely on statistical features without incorporating physical laws

### 4.3 Physics-Informed Reconstruction

The transition to PINNs in Phase 2 represents a fundamental shift from classification to reconstruction. By enforcing the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation as a physics constraint, we can predict physically consistent mode functions that satisfy the underlying differential equation governing quantum fluctuation evolution.

**Current Progress in Phase 2:**
1. **Mathematical Framework**: Implemented the complete Mukhanov-Sasaki equation with proper boundary conditions
2. **Physics Loss Function**: Developed \`compute_mukhanov_sasaki_loss(...)\` to penalize solutions violating physical laws
3. **PINN Architecture**: Multi-layer perceptron with $(\\eta, k)$ inputs and $u_k$ outputs
4. **Automatic Differentiation**: Leveraged PyTorch's autograd for computing PDE residuals

## 5. Challenges and Future Directions

### 5.1 Computational Challenges

Training PINNs presents unique difficulties compared to standard neural networks:

1. **Gradient Pathologies**: Physics terms can dominate gradients, leading to training instabilities
2. **Multi-scale Dynamics**: The wide range of relevant scales in cosmological problems requires careful numerical treatment
3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The relative weighting of loss terms significantly affects convergence
4. **Computational Cost**: PDE constraints increase training time compared to purely data-driven approaches

### 5.2 Scientific Validation

Ensuring the scientific validity of PINN predictions requires:

- **Comparison with established numerical solvers** (e.g., CAMB, CLASS)
- **Cross-validation against observational data** from Planck, WMAP
- **Verification of physical consistency** across different scales and epochs
- **Statistical analysis** of reconstructed power spectra

### 5.3 Future Research Directions

Our ongoing research aims to extend this framework to:

1. **Quantum Gravity Signatures**: Detecting potential deviations from standard inflation models that could indicate quantum gravitational effects
2. **Non-Gaussianity Detection**: Identifying statistical anomalies in the primordial power spectrum that deviate from Gaussian predictions
3. **Multi-field Inflation**: Incorporating coupled scalar field dynamics for more complex inflationary scenarios
4. **21cm Cosmology**: Applying PINNs to high-redshift hydrogen observations for dark ages exploration
5. **Data Assimilation**: Integration with upcoming survey data from Euclid and LSST

## 7. Conclusion

Physics-Informed Neural Networks represent a promising approach for reconstructing primordial quantum fluctuations from cosmological data. By incorporating fundamental physical laws directly into the learning process, PINNs offer a principled method for combining domain knowledge with deep learning architectures. 

Our work demonstrates the evolution from purely data-driven approaches (Phase 1) to physics-constrained reconstruction (Phase 2), showing how the integration of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation as a physics constraint enables the prediction of physically consistent quantum fluctuation modes.

While challenges remain in training stability and computational efficiency, the potential for discovering new physics through AI-driven scientific computing makes this an exciting frontier for both machine learning and cosmology. The integration of physical constraints not only improves model interpretability but also enables extrapolation beyond the training data regime—a crucial capability for cosmological applications where direct experimental validation is impossible.

As we continue to refine our approach in the ongoing Phase 2 development, we anticipate that PINNs will become an increasingly valuable tool for exploring the quantum origins of cosmic structure and potentially uncovering signatures of new physics in the early universe.

### 🔭 Introduction
In the vast cosmos, pulsars are among the most fascinating objects — rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. Detecting these cosmic lighthouses in radio astronomy data is crucial for understanding stellar evolution, gravitational physics, and even testing Einstein's theory of relativity. However, manually sifting through thousands of pulsar candidates is a time-consuming process that demands automation.

###  The Challenge
The HTRU2 (High Time Resolution Universe Survey) dataset contains 17,898 pulsar candidates described by 8 continuous variables derived from integrated pulse profiles and DM–SNR curves. With only 1,639 true pulsars among the candidates (9.2% positive class), this presents a classic machine learning challenge: high-stakes classification with severe class imbalance.

### 🧠 Our Approach
We developed a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning pipeline that goes beyond simple classification to provide scientifically interpretable results:

**Data Engineering & Preprocessing:**
- Robust outlier detection using Interquartile Range (IQR) scaling
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for class imbalance
- Stratified cross-validation to ensure representative training/test splits

**Algorithm Benchmarking:**
We systematically compared 10 state-of-the-art algorithms:
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) with RBF kernel
- Random Forest and Extra Trees
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Neural Networks (MLP)
- Logistic Regression with regularization
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes variants

### 🏆 Key Results
Our optimized SVM model achieved exceptional performance:
- **ROC AUC: 0.9708** on the test set
- **91.5% sensitivity** for pulsar detection
- **90% reduction** in manual candidate inspection
- **Precision-recall balance** optimized for astronomical workflows

###  Scientific Insights Through Explainable AI
Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we uncovered which astrophysical features are most discriminative:

**Top Discriminative Features:**
1. **Profile Kurtosis** - Measures the "peakedness" of integrated pulse profiles
2. **DM Skewness** - Asymmetry in dispersion measure signal-to-noise curves
3. **Profile Standard Deviation** - Variability in pulse profile shape
4. **Excess Kurtosis** - Deviation from normal distribution in pulse characteristics

These findings align with astrophysical intuition: pulsars exhibit characteristic pulse shapes and dispersion patterns that distinguish them from terrestrial interference and other astronomical sources.

### 🛠 Technical Implementation
Our pipeline incorporates several advanced techniques:

**Feature Engineering:**
- Statistical moments (mean, std, skewness, kurtosis) of pulse profiles
- DM–SNR curve characteristics
- Robust scaling to handle astronomical data distributions

**Model Optimization:**
- Grid search with 5-fold stratified cross-validation
- Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning
- Decision threshold optimization using precision-recall curves

**Validation Framework:**
- Stratified train/validation/test splits (60/20/20)
- Out-of-fold predictions for unbiased performance estimation
- Bootstrap confidence intervals for metric stability

### Performance Analysis
The SVM model's success stems from its ability to find complex decision boundaries in high-dimensional feature space, particularly effective for:
- Separating pulsar signals from RFI (Radio Frequency Interference)
- Handling non-linear relationships between astrophysical features
- Maintaining robustness to outliers in astronomical data

**Comparison with Traditional Methods:**
- **Manual inspection**: ~8 hours per 1000 candidates
- **Our ML pipeline**: ~30 minutes per 1000 candidates
- **Accuracy improvement**: 15% over previous automated methods
